# üíå My Favorite Series: Violet Evergarden

***

This series is a masterpiece in animation and emotional depth. It follows Violet, a former child soldier, as she works as an Auto Memory Doll, ghostwriting letters to understand human emotions and the meaning of the last words her major said to her: "I love you."

## ‚ú® Moments That Stand Out

I love the episodes that highlight the power of words:

1.  **Episode 10:** This episode focuses on a mother writing letters to her young daughter for the future. It is incredibly *heartbreaking*.
2.  **The Movie:** The emotional conclusion to Violet's journey.
3.  **The Art:** The animation quality is absolutely **breathtaking** throughout the entire series.
