# 💌 My Favorite Series: Violet Evergarden

***

This series is a masterpiece in animation and emotional depth. It follows Violet, a former child soldier, as she works as an Auto Memory Doll, ghostwriting letters to understand human emotions and the meaning of the last words her major said to her: "I love you."

> "I want to know what 'I love you' means." - Violet Evergarden

## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Genre** | Fantasy, Drama, Slice of Life |
| **Studio** | Kyoto Animation |
| **Format** | 1 Season (13 episodes) + 2 Movies + OVA |
| **Main Theme** | The complexity of **grief** and the journey toward **empathy**. |

## 📝 Character Spotlight

* **Violet Evergarden:** The protagonist, starting as a stoic, detached former soldier.
* **Claudia Hodgins:** Violet's compassionate employer and president of the CH Postal Company.
* **Gilbert Bougainvillea:** The major who gave Violet her name and his last words.

## ✨ Moments That Stand Out

I love the episodes that highlight the power of words:

1.  **Episode 10:** This episode focuses on a mother writing letters to her young daughter for the future. It is incredibly *heartbreaking*.
2.  **The Movie:** The emotional conclusion to Violet's journey.
3.  **The Art:** The animation quality is absolutely **breathtaking** throughout the entire series.
